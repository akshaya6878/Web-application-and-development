            The "Happy Appointment" healthcare booking platform is designed to streamline the process
            of scheduling medical appointments and provide users with valuable information about
            healthcare facilities and practitioners. Users can create accounts by supplying essential
            personal details like names, ages, genders, and email addresses. Upon login, the platform
            presents users with a list of hospitals available in their geographical area, enhancing
            accessibility to healthcare options.<br><br>
            For added convenience, the platform offers robust search functionality. Users can seek
            hospitals based on specific medical needs or specialties and further refine results using filters
            like hospital ratings. Detailed profiles of doctors in each hospital, including names, ages,
            genders, educational backgrounds, and years of experience, are readily accessible,
            empowering users to make informed decisions about their healthcare providers.
            Appointment booking is made hassle-free, enabling users to select a hospital and book
            appointments with their preferred doctors. They can choose appointment dates and time slots
            that align with their schedules. The platform also includes an appointment management
            feature within user profiles, allowing users to keep track of their booked appointments
            effortlessly.<br><br>
            In critical situations, an emergency option is available for users to contact hospitals promptly.
            Each hospital has a predefined capacity for handling emergency patients, ensuring a timely
            response to urgent medical needs (e.g., accommodating up to 10 members). "Happy
            Appointment" is designed to prioritize user convenience and enhance their access to quality
            healthcare services<br><br>
